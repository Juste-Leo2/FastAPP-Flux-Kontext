</p>

## Prerequisites

**System & Hardware**
- Windows 10/11
- NVIDIA GPU compatible with CUDA 12.6
- 16 GB of RAM (minimum)
- 4 GB of VRAM (minimum)
- *Note: This code was tested on a setup with 64 GB of RAM and 12 GB of VRAM.*

## Automatic Installation

Choose the installation method that suits you best.

### Method 1: via the Installation Executable

This is the most direct method and simulates a standard Windows application installation. It's perfect if you prefer a single file to download and run, without handling any code.

#### 1. Download
Download the latest executable from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Juste-Leo2/FastAPP-Flux-Kontext/releases) section.

#### 2. Launch
Windows Defender SmartScreen may prevent the application from running, identifying it as unrecognized software.

<br>
To proceed, click on **More info**, then **Run anyway**.

#### 3. Installation Path
Prefer standard installation locations (e.g., your Desktop or Documents folder). Avoid protected system folders like `C:\Program Files`, which could cause permission issues.

---

### Method 2: via Repository Scripts (Transparency and Control)

This method gives you full control and complete transparency. It's recommended if you prefer to avoid pre-compiled executables or want to inspect the code before running it. Although getting the code is an initial step, **the installation remains fully automatic thanks to the provided scripts**.

You can inspect the scripts' code before running them to verify their content:
- The installation logic is visible in `setup.bat`, `src/setup.ps1`, and `src/install_steps.bat`.
- The application launch script is `run.bat` and `src/run.ps1`.

#### 1. Get the Source Code
You have two options:

*   **Option A (with Git):** Open a terminal and clone the repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Juste-Leo2/FastAPP-Flux-Kontext.git
    cd FastAPP-Flux-Kontext
    ```
*   **Option B (without Git):** Click the green `<> Code` button at the top of the repository page, then `Download ZIP`. Unzip the archive into a folder of your choice.

#### 2. Run the Automatic Installation (`setup.bat`)
Once inside the project folder, double-click the `setup.bat` file. This script will automatically install all necessary components.

**Warning:** Windows Defender SmartScreen may also block this script. As with the executable, click **More info**, then **Run anyway** to allow it.

#### 3. Launch the Application (`run.bat`)
After installation, double-click `run.bat` to start the application. You can create a shortcut for this file on your desktop for easier access.

## Manual Installation

**Required Software**
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the GitHub repository to a directory of your choice.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Juste-Leo2/FastAPP-Flux-Kontext.git
cd FastAPP-Flux-Kontext
```

### 2. Create and Activate Conda Environment

Create a specific Conda environment for this project and activate it.

```bash
conda create -n flux_env python=3.12.1 ca-certificates certifi openssl -y
conda activate flux_env
```

### 3. Install CUDA

Install the compatible CUDA version via Conda.

```bash
conda install -c nvidia/label/cuda-12.6.0 cuda -y
```

### 4. Install uv

Install `uv`, a faster package manager for Python.

```bash
pip install uv
```

### 5. Install Python Dependencies

Install all project dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Install PyTorch with CUDA Support

Install the appropriate PyTorch version for GPU support.

```bash
uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126 --reinstall
```

### 7. Verify GPU Detection by PyTorch

Run the following command to ensure your GPU is correctly detected.

```bash
python -c "import torch; assert torch.cuda.is_available(), 'PyTorch did not detect CUDA!'"
```

### 8. Download Models

Download the required models from the direct links below and place them in the `models/` folder.

- [Download Diffuser (FLUX.1)](https://huggingface.co/mit-han-lab/nunchaku-flux.1-kontext-dev/resolve/main/svdq-int4_r32-flux.1-kontext-dev.safetensors)
- [Download Autoencoder (AE)](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Lumina_Image_2.0_Repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/vae/ae.safetensors)
- [Download T5 Encoder](https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/resolve/main/t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors)
- [Download CLIP-L Encoder](https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/resolve/main/clip_l.safetensors)
- [Download LoRA (Turbo)](https://huggingface.co/alimama-creative/FLUX.1-Turbo-Alpha/resolve/main/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors)

The structure of your `models/` folder should look like this:

```
FastAPP-Flux-Kontext/
â””â”€â”€ models/
    â”œâ”€â”€ svdq-int4_r32-flux.1-kontext-dev.safetensors
    â”œâ”€â”€ ae.safetensors
    â”œâ”€â”€ t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors
    â”œâ”€â”€ clip_l.safetensors
    â””â”€â”€ diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors
```

### 9. Launch the Application

Once the setup is complete, launch the application with the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
```
